# INTERFACE: We first state that anybody linking to THIS_LIBRARY needs to include the current source
# directory, while THIS_LIBRARY itself doesnâ€™t. So this can become an INTERFACE usage requirement.
# Hence you do NOT need to link this directory anymore, linking the library is enough.
# PRIVATE: Include project source dir to path so we can include files like:
# dir/example.h
target_include_directories(source_lib
    # INTERFACE header_lib
    PRIVATE ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}
)
